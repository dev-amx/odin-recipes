    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken katsu (チキンカツ) is made of chicken breast fillet breaded with flour, egg, and Japanese panko breadcrumbs, then deep-fried until golden brown. It's the chicken counterpart of Tonkatsu or pork cutlet.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 piece boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>½ tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 large egg </li>
            <li>½ Tbsp neutral-flavored oil</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup panko</li>
            <li>3 cups neutral-flavored oil</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>It's important to butterfly the chicken breast so the meat will be thinner and cook faster</li>
            <li>With a meat mallet or the back of the knife, pound the chicken to an even thickness, about ¼ to ½ inch</li>
            <li>Start heating the oil to 340ºF (170ºC) over medium-low heat (or low heat, if you need more time to bread the chicken). Prepare three bowls/trays: One with flour, one with panko, and one with an egg.</li>
            <li>Add the oil to the egg and whisk it all together.</li>
            <li>Coat the chicken with the flour and shake off any excess. Then coat it with the beaten egg.Finally, coat the chicken with the panko, pressing the panko into the cutlet so that it adheres well. Remove any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil to 340ºF (170ºC).</li>
            <li>Fry one piece at a time. For chicken katsu, you will deep-fry for a total of 3 minutes, turning the chicken once at the halfway point.</li>
            <li>Deep-fry until both sides are golden brown. Remove the cutlet from the oil and hold it vertically over the pot for a few seconds to drain the excess oil. Then, transfer it to a wire rack or paper towel-lined tray. If possible, keep it vertically to drain the excess oil.</li>
            <li>Cut the chicken into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces and serve it with tonkatsu sauce. Typically, chicken katsu is served with a side of shredded cabbage salad and salad dressing</li>
        </ol>
