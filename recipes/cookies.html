 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>These homemade Chocolate Chip Cookies are the BEST! One special ingredient helps deepens the flavor and gives the chocolate chip cookies a chewier texture.</p>

 <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups (350g) all-purpose four</li>
        <li>2 to 4 tablespoons nonfat milk powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (161g) dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup (8 ounces) unsalted butter, very soft</li> 
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>12 ounce bag (about 2 cups) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, milk powder, salt, and baking soda and whisk to mix. Set aside.</li>
        <li>With an electric mixer or in a stand mixer with a beater attachment, beat together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and softened butter on medium speed until combined, 30 to 60 seconds. Pick out any large pebbles of hard brown sugar that you see. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters.</li>
        <li>Add the two eggs and vanilla to the butter-sugar mixture and beat at medium speed until no clumps or streaks remain, 10 to 20 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters.</li>
        <li>Add the flour mixture all at once. Beat on low speed just until no more dry streaks of flour are visible, 20 to 40 seconds. You may still see some flecks of milk powder -- this is fine.</li>
        <li>Add all of the chocolate chips and beat on low speed for just a few seconds until the chips are evenly incorporated.</li>
        <li>Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beater. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to three days. (Or freeze in individual scoops for up to 3 months.)</li>
        <li>Place a rack in the middle of the oven. Line two baking sheet with silicon baking mats or parchment.</li>
        <li>Use a medium cookie scoop (or a well-mounded tablespoon measure) to scoop the dough out onto one of the baking sheet. Space the cookies about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>While the first batch bakes, scoop the cookies for the next batch.The cookies are done when they look slightly puffed in the middle and are starting to turn toasty at the edges.</li>
        <li>Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes, or until the puffed middles collapse and the cookies have firmed a little. Transfer the cookies to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
